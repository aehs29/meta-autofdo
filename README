meta-autofdo is a proof of concept layer for autofdo on Yocto.

You need to manually copy autofdo.bbclass to meta/classes/ on your Yocto environment!.

You need to add the path to meta-autofdo to bblayers.conf

Usage:

When profiling (default):
AUTOFDO_FLAG = "0"

When deploying enhanced application:
AUTOFDO_FLAG = "1"

# bubble acts as an example recipe
Steps: 
 - The bubble recipe must inherit autofdo
 - Set AUTOFDO_FLAG = "0" on local.conf
 - Include bubble on image via local.conf: CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "bubble"
 - Run bitbake to build distribution: bitbake core-image-minimal
 - Profile application on system: 
	$ autofdo_bubble

*** This will ultimately create the file bubble.gcov ***

- Copy bubble.gcov to the build environment
- Set AUTOFDO_FLAG = "1" on local.conf
- Rebuild optimized distribution: bitbake -k core-image-minimal
- Enjoy...
