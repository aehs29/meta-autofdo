# ToDo list on meta-autofdo

- Fix perf on oe-core(master) to be able to get the profile data

- Fix ocperf from pmu-tools to be able to get perf events(e.g. br_inst_retired_near_taken)
 by name and not by code, this would require research to check the code for
 all the different architectures (if they have it).

- Test on other architectures and get statistics.

- Include more examples, preferrably written in different languages to compare performance.
